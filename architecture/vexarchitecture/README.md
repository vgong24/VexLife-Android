# VexArchitecture — refined foundation snapshot

## Why this exists

Draft PR #206 accumulated valuable discovery together with 100+ commits of experimentation,
renaming, regression, correction, and contradictory architectural claims. Its latest source is useful
provenance, but its branch history is not a safe canonical starting point for another AI instance.

This snapshot preserves only the parts that survived the subtractive review far enough to be useful
as a clean reference:

~~~text
VexFamily
    State
    Control
    Act
    Effect

CURRENT State + Control
-> Act?
-> admitted State? + Effect?

DisplayState<Family, State>
Projection<Family, State, Display>
~~~

and the ThemeMode patient-zero language:

~~~text
Control.Select(mode)
-> Effect.Save(mode)
~~~

The word **Save** is preserved deliberately. The durability work originally described a latest
durable Save and the concrete Store operation remains `save(...)`. Later names such as
`PersistSelection` and `PersistenceExecution.persist(...)` are not treated as authoritative simply
because they appeared later in #206.

## Reference source

~~~text
reference/behavior/VexFamily.kt
reference/ui/ThemeMode.kt
~~~

These are source snapshots, not production duplicates. They exist so a successor can recover the
refined semantic grammar without replaying #206 or silently inheriting its later vocabulary.

## Current architecture posture

~~~text
PRESERVE

Direct Family semantic grammar
Family-owned DisplayState / Projection coordinates
Control payload vs typed identity distinction as a demonstrated requirement
Connection/runtime outside Family
Effect as requested runtime transformation, not resulting truth
Save language for ThemeMode durability

RE-DERIVE BEFORE IMPLEMENTING

RelationshipId exact Kotlin representation
VexExecution active custody kernel
relationship-addressed cancellation API
observation/recovery realization
VexLogger production record schema
debug expectation/discrepancy projection
VexBoard projection

DO NOT CARRY FORWARD MERELY BECAUSE #206 HAS THEM

OwnerToken
CoordinationKey
CoordinationIdentity
SourceRef as architectural identity
process-global InstanceId
public Handle as required architecture
Snapshot as a second runtime history model
activeExecutions as a second active-work truth
callable-based cancellation identity
ThemeModeRelationships registry
family.relationship(control)
append(effect) as automatic identity
PersistSelection / PersistenceExecution.persist naming
~~~

The full reasoning boundary is recorded in `REFINED-BOUNDARIES.md`.

Those hashes explain where the snapshot came from. They do not make #206 current architecture
authority.

## Reconstruction rule

A successor implementing this architecture should:

~~~text
1. start from current main
2. read this snapshot
3. port the preserved source shape intentionally
4. re-derive held runtime/logging pieces from demonstrated consumers
5. prove each preserved requirement against the smaller implementation
6. open a fresh clean PR whose commits explain the accepted reasons
~~~

Do not preserve a type, key, helper, registry, alias, or diagnostic field merely because deleting it
would require rewriting #206 tests. Preserve the requirement the test was trying to prove and ask
whether the smaller architecture proves it more directly.
